Layouts::
Layout means arrangement of the components on the screen.
1. Linear Layout
2. Constraint Layout

4. Frame Layout
5. Grid Layout

By Default when you will create your first android application...You will get constrained Layout
But...We can change the Layout as per our Requirement...

Linear layout is very easy to use...Which is used to Arrange the components either horizontally or vertically...
